            <img id="Left" src="pizza.jpeg" alt="tree" style="width:100px; height:100px;"> Pizza is an Italian dish
            typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato,
            cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. <br><br>
            One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato
            sauce,
            mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who
            was
            said to
            have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were
            those of
            the Italian flag.
