        <h2>Stars- Float Property</h2>

        <p>A star is a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by self-gravity.The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.
            Many
            other stars are visible to the naked eye at night; their immense distances from Earth make them appear as
            fixed points
            of light.</p>

            Historically, stars have been important to civilizations throughout the world. They have been part of
            religious
            practices, divination rituals, mythology, used for celestial navigation and orientation, to mark the passage
            of seasons,
            and to define calendars.
